### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

**Akrausz23/Akrausz23** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

My previous coding experience is using Visual Basic in middleschool, using SCRATCH in 9th grade, and then small things my stepdad has taught me over the years.
The reason I'm taking this class is because I feel like its important to have a general understanding to coding, and it has interested me for a little while now.
I'm interested in the sciences like biology, and I love soccer. 
I want to be able to build a toolbox in my head of function that I know, and it will allow me to work towards and task thats given in the course. I'd like to complete a maze tyoe game for my next IDP, and I already have some ideas on how to it.
